Fundamentals of Multiagent Systems
==================================

Using NetLogo Examples
----------------------

by

Jose M Vidal

The goal of this book is to cover all the material that a competent
multiagent practitioner or researcher should be familiar with. Of
course, since this is a relatively new field the list of required
material is still growing and there is some uncertainty as to what are
the most important ideas. I have chosen to concentrate on the
theoretical aspects of multiagent systems since these ideas have been
around for a long time and are important for a wide variety of
applications. I have stayed away from technological issues because
these are evolving very fast. 

The book is linked to a large number of sample NetLogo programs. These
programs are meant to be used by the reader as an aid in understanding
emergent decentralized behaviors.
